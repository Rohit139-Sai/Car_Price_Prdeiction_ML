# ðŸš— Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project was developed as part of **SystemTron ML Internship â€“ Week 2 Task**.

It focuses on predicting the resale value of used cars using a machine learning model, based on features such as:
- Year of manufacture
- Kilometers driven
- Fuel type

The goal is to build a regression model that can estimate the car price accurately based on these inputs.
